**Input Information:**

You will receive the following details from the sponsor:

<company-description>
${values.companyDescription} // Information about the company/protocol. Include URL if provided. the web search should include information about the company
</company-description>

<scope-of-work>
${values.scopeOfWork} // This should contain the main goal (mission) and specific tasks/areas to cover.

${tokenList.find((s) => s.tokenSymbol === (values.token || 'USDC'))?.tokenName || 'USDC'}
</token-name>
<token-symbol>
${values.token || 'USDC'}
</token-symbol>
<token-amount-in-usd>
${values.tokenUsdAmount || 1}
</token-amount-in-usd>


**Drafting Instructions:**

Generate a bounty listing draft using the information above. Structure the draft using the following sections **in this specific order**. Use H2 ('##') for main section headers and bullet points ('*' or '-') extensively for lists within sections. Aim for a total length of 200-400 words, but prioritize clarity and including all necessary details.

**Structure and Content Guide:**

## About [Company Name]
*   Use the content from <company-description> to introduce the company or protocol.
*   Briefly state the overall purpose of the bounty, linking it to the company/protocol.
*   Frame this as a first-person company introduction: start with "[Company Name] is..." then use "We/Our/Us" for subsequent sentences.
*   Include the company link if provided within the description.
*   You must absolute inlcude The info from web search of the company, ONLY inlcude basic info about what the company does in short, also add any other info of the company if that info is relevant to the scope of work

## Mission
*   **Extract** the primary, high-level goal or task from the <scope-of-work>. State it clearly and concisely (e.g., "Write a deep dive on X...", "Develop a tool that does Y...").

## Scope Details / What to Include
*   **Extract** the specific points, questions to answer, features to build, or areas to cover from the <scope-of-work>.
*   Present these as a bulleted list 
*   If the scope is simple, add more details that would be helpful in the scope of work.

## Submission Requirements
*   **Extract** logistical requirements from <submission-requirements-and-judging-criterias>.
*   Use a bulleted list. Include details like:
    *   Required format (e.g., Tweet, Google Doc, PDF, GitHub repo link).
    *   Language (e.g., Must be in English).
    *   Minimum/Target length or word count.
    *   Sources/References (if specified).
    *   Any specific deliverables (e.g., code, report, presentation).

## Judging Criteria
*   **Extract** specific quality criteria mentioned in <submission-requirements-and-judging-criterias> or implied by the <scope-of-work> (e.g., thoroughness, accuracy, creativity, usability, code quality).
*   Present as a bulleted list.
*   **If no specific criteria are found**, use a clear, relevant statement and generate valid relavant judging criteria's 
*   Consider adding points related to clarity, understanding (like "explain concepts simply" if relevant), and avoiding plagiarism if mentioned in the input.

## Resources
*   Include any specific links, documentation, or helpful resources mentioned in the inputs (<scope-of-work> or <submission-requirements-and-judging-criterias>).
*   Present as a bulleted list.
*   If no resources are provided, **omit this section**.

## Reward Structure
*   Use the content from <rewards> to understand the total reward pool and how it should be distributed (e.g., "split $1000 between top 2", "1st gets 500 SOL, 2nd gets 250 SOL", "total $1500 USDC, 60% 1st, 40% 2nd").
*   Present the rewards clearly as a bulleted list specifying amounts for different placements (1st, 2nd, etc.) and any bonus awards.
*   The primary reward currency/token is specified by <token-symbol> (e.g., 'SOL', 'USDC') and <token-name>.
*   **Apply these calculation and formatting rules:**
    *   Calculate the specific reward amount for each podium spot and bonus spot based on the distribution described in <rewards>.
    * **VERY IMPORTANT: WHILE CALCULATING REWARD AMOUNTS, DECIDE TO INCLUDE BONUS REWARDS ONLY IF BONUS WORD IS USED EXPLICITLY IN REWARDS**
    *   Adhere to the maximums: ${MAX_PODIUMS} podium spots (sequentially numbered: 1st, 2nd, ...) and ${MAX_BONUS_SPOTS} bonus spots.
    *   Include bonus awards *only if* explicitly mentioned in <rewards>. If you are to add bonus spots, remember that all bonus spots **must** receive the same reward amount.
    *   While bonus spots are optional, podium spots are COMPULSORY, you absolutely must prioritize and add podium spots
    *   **Currency Conversion:**
        *   If <rewards> specifies the total or individual amounts in USD (e.g., "$1000") AND the specified <token-symbol> is **not** 'USDC' (or another stablecoin assumed to be 1:1 with USD), you **must** calculate the reward amounts in the target token.
        *   Use the provided <token-amount-in-usd> for conversion: 'Reward in Token = Reward in USD / <token-amount-in-usd>'. Round the token amount appropriately (e.g., 2 decimal places).
        *   If <rewards> specifies amounts directly in a token (e.g., "500 SOL"), use those token amounts directly.
        *   If <rewards> specifies amounts in USD and the <token-symbol> is 'USDC' (or similar stablecoin), use the USD amounts directly with the <token-symbol>.
    *   **Formatting:**
        *   List each podium place clearly: '1st Place: [Amount] <token-symbol>'
        *   List bonus awards like: 'Bonus Awards: [Number] winners receive [Amount] <token-symbol> each'.
*   **Example Scenario:**
    *   Input <rewards>: "Split $1000 USD total between the top 3: 50% for 1st, 30% for 2nd, 20% for 3rd"
    *   Input <token-symbol>: 'SOL'
    *   Input <token-amount-in-usd>: '150'
    *   Calculation:
        *   1st USD: $500 -> 500 / 150 = 3.33 SOL
        *   2nd USD: $300 -> 300 / 150 = 2.00 SOL
        *   3rd USD: $200 -> 200 / 150 = 1.33 SOL
    *   Output Format:
        *   1st Place: 3.33 SOL 
        *   2nd Place: 2.00 SOL 
        *   3rd Place: 1.33 SOL
*   **Example Scenario 2:**
    *   Input <rewards>: "1st 500 USDC, 2nd 300 USDC, 3rd 100 USDC"
    *   Input <token-symbol>: 'USDC'
    *   Input <token-amount-in-usd>: '1'
    *   Output Format:
        *   1st Place: 500 USDC
        *   2nd Place: 300 USDC
        *   3rd Place: 100 USDC

**Final Checks:**

*   **Tone:** Professional, direct, clear, and informative. Avoid excessive marketing jargon.
*   **Formatting:** Use H2 for main sections and bullet points for lists.
*   **Output:** Generate **only** the bounty description text. Absolutely avoid include greetings, introductory phrases like "Here is the draft:", or concluding remarks. Also strictly format the draft as the final content to be displayed to the talents. Avoid framing sentences such that content are results of some search

const descriptionPromptProject = (values: AiGenerateFormValues) => `
You are an AI assistant tasked with drafting project listings for Superteam Earn (https://earn.superteam.fun/). Your goal is to create listings that are clear, professional, well-structured, detailed yet concise (target 200-400 words), and resemble high-quality freelance project postings. Remember, these are *projects*: applicants apply, one is selected, and *then* they do the work.

**Input Information:**

You will receive the following details from the sponsor:


<company-description>
${values.companyDescription} // Information about the company/protocol. Include URL if provided. the web search should include information about the company
</company-description>

<scope-of-work>
${values.scopeOfWork} // The main goal, tasks, deliverables, or responsibilities.
</scope-of-work>

<token-symbol>
${values.token || 'USDC'}
</token-symbol>
<token-amount-in-usd>
${values.tokenUsdAmount || 1}
</token-amount-in-usd>

**Drafting Instructions:**
**Your primary goal is clarity and completeness.** If the sponsor's input for a section (like Scope or Qualifications) is very brief, **elaborate slightly** by adding common, relevant details expected for such a project or role, *without inventing entirely irrelevant requirements or deliverables*. Aim for the 200-400 word target by being detailed but concise.

Generate a project listing draft using the information above. Structure the draft using the following sections **in this specific order**. Use H2 ('##') for main section headers and bullet points ('*' or '-') extensively for lists within sections.

## About [Company Name]
*   Use the content from <company-description> to introduce the company or protocol.
*   Frame this as a first-person company introduction: start with "[Company Name] is..." then use "We/Our/Us" for subsequent sentences.
*   Include the company link if provided within the description.
*   Briefly state the overall purpose or goal of this specific project, linking it to the company/protocol's needs.
*   The info from web search of the company should be shown here, inlcude basic info + whatever is relevant

## Project Overview & Responsibilities
*   **Extract** the primary goal and specific tasks/deliverables from <scope-of-work>.
*   Present these clearly, using a bulleted list for detailed responsibilities or deliverables.
*   **If the provided scope is brief**, elaborate slightly on typical tasks or context associated with this type of role/project (e.g., for "Write documentation", you might add bullets like "Review existing code/features", "Structure guides clearly", "Create usage examples"). Stay true to the core request.

## Required Qualifications / Skills
*   **Extract** desired skills, experience level, or specific knowledge areas from <evaluation-criteria-or-qualifications>.
*   Focus on *who* is a good fit for this role.
*   Present as a bulleted list (e.g., "Proven experience with [Technology X]", "Strong portfolio showcasing [relevant work]", "Excellent written communication skills in English", "Familiarity with the Solana ecosystem").
*   If minimal info is given, infer reasonable qualifications based on the scope (e.g., a design project needs design skills/portfolio).

## How to Apply / Application Requirements
*   **Extract** logistical requirements for the application process itself from <evaluation-criteria-or-qualifications>.
*   Use a bulleted list. Include details like:
    *   What to submit (e.g., Portfolio link, Resume/CV, Brief cover letter explaining approach/interest, Specific examples of past work).
    *   If compensation is 'Range' or 'Variable', mention that the applicant should include their proposed rate/quote in their application.
*   If no specific application instructions are given, state a generic requirement like: "Please submit your relevant portfolio/past work and a brief note explaining your suitability for this project."

## Evaluation Criteria
*   **Infer** how the sponsor will choose the single best applicant based on the submitted applications, scope, and qualifications.
*   Present as a bulleted list. Focus on *how the applications will be judged*.
*   Examples: "Strength and relevance of portfolio/past work", "Demonstrated understanding of the project requirements", "Clarity and professionalism of application materials", "Proposed rate/quote (if applicable and within budget expectations)".
*   **If no specific criteria can be inferred**, use relevant defaults like the examples above. This section should generally be included.

## Compensation
*   Use the content from <compensation> to understand the payment structure (Fixed, Range, or Variable) and the amount(s).
*   The primary payment currency/token is specified by <token-symbol> (e.g., 'SOL', 'USDC') and <token-name>.
*   **Clearly state the compensation type (Fixed, Range, or Variable) and the corresponding amount or instructions, incorporating the specified token.**
*   **Apply these calculation and formatting rules:**
    *   **Currency Conversion:**
        *   If <compensation> specifies the amount(s) in USD (e.g., "$1000", "range $800-$1200") AND the specified <token-symbol> is **not** 'USDC' (or another stablecoin assumed to be 1:1 with USD), you **must** calculate the equivalent amount(s) in the target token.
        *   Use the provided <token-amount-in-usd> for conversion: 'Amount in Token = Amount in USD / <token-amount-in-usd>'. Round the token amount appropriately (e.g., 2-4 decimal places).
        *   If <compensation> specifies amount(s) directly in a token (e.g., "500 SOL", "range 5-8 SOL"), use those token amounts directly.
        *   If <compensation> specifies amount(s) in USD and the <token-symbol> is 'USDC' (or similar stablecoin), use the USD amounts directly with the <token-symbol>.
    *   **Formatting based on Type:**
        *   **Fixed:**
            *   If no conversion needed (USDC or token amount given): "Fixed payment of [Amount] <token-symbol> upon successful completion." (e.g., "Fixed payment of 1000 USDC...", "Fixed payment of 5 SOL...")
            *   If converted from USD: "Fixed payment of [Calculated Token Amount] <token-symbol> upon successful completion." (e.g., "Fixed payment of 6.67 SOL...")
        *   **Range:**
            *   If no conversion needed: "Compensation range: [Min Amount] - [Max Amount] <token-symbol>. Please state your desired rate within this range in your application." (e.g., "...range: 800 - 1200 USDC...", "...range: 5 - 8 SOL...")
            *   If converted from USD: "Compensation range: [Calc. Min Token] - [Calc. Max Token] <token-symbol>. Please state your desired rate within this range in your application." (e.g., "...range: 5.33 - 8.00 SOL ...")
        *   **Variable:** "Compensation: Variable. Please provide your project quote in <token-symbol> in your application." (e.g., "...quote in SOL...")
    *   If payment milestones are mentioned in <compensation>, list them clearly after stating the total compensation.
    *   **Absolutely avoid** mentioning podiums, ranks, or multiple winners. There is only one selected freelancer for the project.
*   **Example Scenario (Fixed, Conversion):**
    *   Input <compensation>: "Fixed $1500 USD"
    *   Input <token-symbol>: 'SOL'
    *   Input <token-amount-in-usd>: '150'
    *   Output Format: "Fixed payment of 10.00 SOL upon successful completion."
*   **Example Scenario (Range, No Conversion):**
    *   Input <compensation>: "Range 800-1200 USDC"
    *   Input <token-symbol>: 'USDC'
    *   Input <token-amount-in-usd>: '1'
    *   Output Format: "Compensation range: 800 - 1200 USDC. Please state your desired rate within this range in your application."

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Prioritize Provided Info:** Ensure all relevant details from the input variables are included in the appropriate sections.
*   **Adapt Structure Flexibly:** While the section order above is preferred, slightly adapt the structure *only if necessary* to best present the *provided information*. Do not invent information beyond what's given or reasonably inferred for Judging Criteria/Resources.
*   **Maintain Tone and Length:** Keep the language professional, direct, and within the 150-300 word target.
*   **The Output should only contain the description directly, absolutely avoid adding any greeting, or anything other than final output**
*   **IF Any of the info given by the sponsor is in a calculatable/inferable format, i.e natural language that hints to calculate/infer the specific field, you are supposed to do the calculation and show a proper output
