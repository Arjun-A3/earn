# Motion (formerly Framer Motion) â€” Cursor Rule

## Summary

- **Framer Motion** has been rebranded and spun out as an independent project called **Motion**.
- The official site is now [https://motion.dev](https://motion.dev).
- The library is no longer under the Framer umbrella, but is maintained by the original author with Framer's support.
- Motion now supports not just React, but also vanilla JS and other frameworks (e.g., Vue).

## Import Path Changes

- **Old (Framer Motion):**
  ```js
  import { motion } from "framer-motion"
  ```
- **New (Motion):**
  ```js
  import { motion } from "motion/react"
  ```
- The npm package is now `motion` (not `framer-motion`).


2. **Imports:**
   - new import path: `import { motion } from "framer-motion"` to `import { motion } from "motion/react"`.


## Key Points for LLMs and Users
- **Framer Motion** and **Motion** refer to the same animation library, but Motion is the new, actively maintained version.
- All new documentation, features, and support are at [motion.dev](https://motion.dev).
- Do **not** use `framer-motion` for new projects; use `motion` instead.
- For React, always import from `motion/react`.
- If you see references to Framer Motion in older code or docs, they now map to Motion.
- Everything component / code inside the library is same, only the import path for react is updated
